class GraphPESModel(nn.Module, ABC):
    r"""
    All models implemented in ``graph-pes`` are subclasses of
    :class:`~graph_pes.GraphPESModel`.

    These models make predictions (via the
    :meth:`~graph_pes.GraphPESModel.predict` method) of the
    following properties:

    .. list-table::
            :header-rows: 1

            * - Key
              - Single graph
              - Batch of graphs
            * - :code:`"local_energies"`
              - :code:`(N,)`
              - :code:`(N,)`
            * - :code:`"energy"`
              - :code:`()`
              - :code:`(M,)`
            * - :code:`"forces"`
              - :code:`(N, 3)`
              - :code:`(N, 3)`
            * - :code:`"stress"`
              - :code:`(3, 3)`
              - :code:`(M, 3, 3)`

    assuming an input of an :class:`~graph_pes.AtomicGraph` representing a
    single structure composed of ``N`` atoms, or an
    :class:`~graph_pes.AtomicGraph` composed of ``M`` structures and containing
    a total of ``N`` atoms. (see :func:`~graph_pes.atomic_graph.is_batch` for
    more information about batching).

    Implementations must override the
    :meth:`~graph_pes.GraphPESModel.forward` method to generate a
    dictionary of predictions for the given graph. As a minimum, this must
    include a per-atom energy contribution (``"local_energies"``).

    For any other properties not returned by the forward pass,
    the :meth:`~graph_pes.GraphPESModel.predict` method will automatically
    infer these properties from the local energies as required:

    * ``"energy"``: as the sum of the local energies per structure.
    * ``"forces"``: as the negative gradient of the energy with respect to the
      atomic positions.
    * ``"stress"``: as the negative gradient of the energy with respect to a
      symmetric expansion of the unit cell.

    For more details on how these are calculated, see :doc:`../theory`.

    :class:`~graph_pes.GraphPESModel` objects save various peices of extra
    metadata to the ``state_dict`` via the
    :meth:`~graph_pes.GraphPESModel.get_extra_state` and
    :meth:`~graph_pes.GraphPESModel.set_extra_state` methods.
    If you want to save additional extra state to the ``state_dict`` of your
    model, please implement the :meth:`~graph_pes.GraphPESModel.extra_state`
    property and corresponding setter to ensure that you do not overwrite
    these extra metadata items.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cutoff
        The cutoff radius for the model.
    implemented_properties
        The property predictions that the model implements in the forward pass.
        Must include at least ``"local_energies"``.

        Pre-fit the model, and all its components, to the training data.

        Some models require pre-fitting to the training data to set certain
        parameters. For example, the :class:`~graph_pes.models.pairwise.LennardJones`
        model uses the distribution of interatomic distances in the training data
        to set the length-scale parameter.

        In the ``graph-pes-train`` routine, this method is called before
        "normal" training begins (you can turn this off with a config option).

        This method does two things:

        1. iterates over all the model's :class:`~torch.nn.Module` components
           (inlcuding itself) and calls their :meth:`pre_fit` method (if it exists -
           see for instance :class:`~graph_pes.models.LearnableOffset` for
           an example of a model-specific pre-fit method, and
           :class:`~graph_pes.models.components.scaling.LocalEnergiesScaler` for
           an example of a component-specific pre-fit method).
        2. registers all the unique atomic numbers in the training data with
           all of the model's :class:`~graph_pes.utils.nn.PerElementParameter`
           instances to ensure correct parameter counting.

        If the model has already been pre-fitted, subsequent calls to
        :meth:`pre_fit_all_components` will be ignored (and a warning will be raised).
